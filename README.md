# CPScrape: An all purpose scraper + educational website for competitive programmers

### About CP Scrape:
As university students, interns, tech enthusiasts or professionals, people trying to keep up with competitive programming might have often faced difficulties like finding proper practice resources arranged according to your elo/rating, finding good blogs by top coders, important informations, editorials, etc. Also another problem that competitive programmers face is with keeping up with dates of upcoming contests across multiple websites. <br>

<b> Well, CPScrape is here to solve all these problems for you. </b> We have looked into common problems faced by competitive programmers and developed this website as a solution to that.<br>

- The main feature of CPScrape is to collect dates and details of upcoming contests from multiple websites like Codeforces, Topcoder, Codechef, Leetcode etc. and produce all of them in one place so that you don't have to manually keep up with all the contests and minimizes your chances of missing out on a contest <br>

- It also collects the best free resources from all across the internet (videos and articles) related to competitive programming and groups them according to topics and difficulty and provides them all in one place so that you dont have to navigate millions of websites for resources. <br>

- And last but not the least, it also has practice materials like ladders, problem sheets containing famous and critical problems arranged according to their difficulties to help you make in in the game of CP. The practice materaials are arranged accoring to ratings of participants across websites (like codeforces and codechef) for example there is a sheet of problems for newbies, pupils, candidates, grandmasters and so on.

## Our target is to spread CPScrape to the entire competitive programming community to provide a smoother and more efficient approach to CP with minimum time loss to avoid that TLE (iykyk) <br>
